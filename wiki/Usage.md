## Interface Elements

- **Header**: Displays the current owner context (Personal Account or Organization name), active sort and direction, fork status tracking state, and active search/filter.
- **Status Bar**: Shows loaded count vs total. A rate-limit line displays `remaining/limit` and the reset time; it turns yellow when remaining ≤ 10% of the limit.

## Pagination Details

- Uses GitHub GraphQL `viewer.repositories` with `ownerAffiliations: OWNER`, ordered by `UPDATED_AT DESC`.
- Fetches 15 repos per page by default (configurable via `REPOS_PER_FETCH` environment variable, 1-50).
- Updates `totalCount` each time and prefetches the next page when selection nears the end of loaded list.

## Environment Variables

- `REPOS_PER_FETCH`: Number of repositories to fetch per page (1-50, default: 15)
- `GH_MANAGER_DEBUG=1`: Enables debug mode with performance metrics and detailed errors
- `APOLLO_TTL_MS`: Custom cache TTL in milliseconds (default: 30 minutes)
