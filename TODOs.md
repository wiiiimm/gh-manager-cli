    - On success: close modal, remove repo from list, refresh totalCount
    - On failure: show error in modal with proper error handling

- [x] Sync fork with upstream
  - Assigned key `Ctrl+S` to trigger sync
  - Only shown for forked repositories that are behind upstream
  - Confirmation modal showing:
    - Fork name and upstream repository
    - Number of commits behind
    - Warning about potential conflicts
  - Execute sync via GitHub REST API (POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/merge-upstream)
    - Requires `contents:write` scope and push permissions
    - Request body: `{ "branch": "main" }` (or current default branch)
  - On success:
    - Update local repo state to show 0 commits behind
    - Show success message with number of commits pulled
    - Close modal and refresh the repository display
  - On conflict (409 response):
    - Show error explaining manual merge needed

    - User can edit or clear and retype; value cannot be empty (trimmed)
    - `Esc` cancels and closes the modal without changes
  - On submit:
    - Attempt rename via GitHub API (GraphQL mutation); validate scopes/permissions
    - Success: close modal and update the repo in local list (name and nameWithOwner); re-run local sorting if applicable; no server refetch required

- [~] Add automated test suite
  - [x] Test infrastructure setup (Vitest with TypeScript support)
  - [x] Added `pnpm test` script for running tests
  - [ ] Integrate into CI (GitHub Actions)

  - [x] `github.ts` - API interaction helpers (8 tests)
  - [ ] State management and reducers in RepoList
  
  **Component Tests:**
  - [x] `RepoRow` - Basic rendering test (1 test) - Updated spacing logic tested
  - [x] `DeleteModal` - Logic tests for verification code (4 tests)
  - [x] `RepoListHeader` - Header rendering and stats display (8 tests)
  - [x] `RepoListHeaderVisibility` - Visibility filter display tests (new test file)
  - [x] `FilterInput` - Input handling and filter logic (6 tests - mocked TextInput)
  - [x] `SlowSpinner` - Animation component (5 tests)

  **Integration Tests:**
  - [ ] Modal flow tests with simulated keyboard input (limited by testing framework)
  - [ ] Infinite scroll behavior
  - [ ] Search functionality
  - [ ] Sorting and filtering combinations
  - [ ] Rate limit handling
  
  **Current Progress:**

  - Utilities with tests: 4/4 (100%)
  
  **Testing Approach for useInput Components:**
  Successfully implemented mocking strategy for components using `useInput` hook:
  - Mock the `ink` module's `useInput` function directly
  - Use dynamic imports to avoid ESM/CommonJS issues
  - Test rendering and basic UI display
  - Note: Interactive keyboard behavior tests are limited but UI rendering tests work well

- [x] Organization support
  - Switch between personal and organizations
  - List orgs (viewer.organizations) and browse their repos
  - Owner affiliation filters (OWNER, COLLABORATOR, ORGANIZATION_MEMBER)
  - Switching UI
    - Show a picker overlay listing:
      - Personal Account (@your_github_handle)
      - Organizations (name and @login)
    - Keyboard: assign `W` (Workspace/Who) to open the switcher; Up/Down to select; Enter to switch; Esc to cancel
    - Persist last-selected context and show it in header (e.g., "Repositories — Personal Account" or "Repositories — org: @acme")
    - Apply context to repo queries (scoped owner/org), and refresh list/totalCount on switch
  - Implemented features:
    - OrgSwitcher component with organization listing
    - Context persistence in UI preferences
    - Dynamic GraphQL queries for personal vs org repositories
    - Header displays current context (org/@user or @user)
    - Automatic affiliation switching (OWNER for personal, ORGANIZATION_MEMBER for orgs)

- [ ] Bulk selection and actions
  - Multi-select mode
    - Enter multi-select with a key (e.g., `M`)

    - Show selected count in header/footer
  - Bulk operations
    - Bulk archive/unarchive selected
    - Bulk delete selected (with aggregate confirmation including per-repo list)
    - Two-step confirm for destructive operations; follow modal UX (Left/Right, Enter, Y/C)
  - Performance and UX

    - On success: update local list states (archived flag or removal) without full refetch
    - On failure: show summary with failed items and suggested remediation

- [x] Infinite scroll improvements
  - [x] Inline loading indicator at end of list
    - When user reaches end of loaded repos, show spinner/loading message inline

    - Keep existing repos visible while fetching next page
  - [x] Smarter prefetching trigger
    - Changed prefetch trigger from "5 items from end" to "80% from bottom"
    - Calculates: trigger when `cursor >= Math.floor(loadedItems.length * 0.8)`
    - Prevents user from ever reaching actual end before more data loads
    - Smoother infinite scroll experience with earlier prefetching
    - Added debug messages to track when prefetching occurs

- [x] Footer reorganization and UI improvements
  - [x] Reorganized footer into 3 logical lines for better organization
    - Line 1: Navigation controls (Refresh, Org Switch, Logout, Quit)
    - Line 2: View/Filter controls (Top, Bottom, Search, Sort, Direction, Density, Fork Status, Visibility)
    - Line 3: Repository actions (Info, Cache Info, Archive, Delete, Sync Fork)
  - [x] Updated Delete key binding to Del/Backspace (no Ctrl required)
  - [x] Renamed "Forks - Commits Behind" to "Fork Status - Commits Behind"

  - [x] Color thresholds (yellow when low)
  - [x] Toggle to show/hide "commits behind" for forks
    - Key binding: `f` to toggle fork commit tracking on/off
    - When disabled: exclude expensive commit history queries from GraphQL
    - Saves significant API rate limit usage (removes defaultBranchRef.target.history queries)
    - Show toggle state in header: "Forks: ON/OFF"
    - Persist preference in config alongside other UI settings
    - When toggled on: smart refresh to populate commit counts if data missing

    - Visual focus indication on selected button
  - On success: show a short-lived footer toast (e.g., "Copied SSH URL" or "Copied HTTPS URL")
  - On failure: show error toast with suggestion
  - Cross‑platform clipboard
    - Prefer `clipboardy` dependency; fallback to OS commands: macOS `pbcopy`, Windows `clip`, Linux `xclip`/`xsel`/`wl-copy`
    - Silent no‑op if clipboard utility absent and `clipboardy` unavailable, but show error toast

- [x] OAuth login flow (alternative to token) ✓ COMPLETED
